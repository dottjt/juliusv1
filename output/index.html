				<p>
				Life wasn't difficult, so much that it was contrived. Growing up with a string of father figures ranging from the incompetent to the disorderly, all that was left to abhor was my mother - an irrational judgement of backhanded self-criticism and conditional hugs. Ultimately, the family had died before it had even begun, packed away in a box for future generations to discover.
				</p>

				<p>I wasn't a particularly dedicated or passionate child. All I cared to do was play video games, delegating what little responsibility I had towards cultivating the teenage fantasy of groping cheap women draping what little promiscuity they had in the loose attitudes sweating from their busts; a pinnacle for those too afraid of the initimacy they were denied. 
				</p>
				<p>I was just another kid with the expectations of an investment banker, pretending to do his best whilst utterly chaotic in a jumbled mess of hostility and unaccompanied resentment. Heavily unadjusted for reality, I would feign curiosity upon the unmet expectations of my mother, bleeding tar under the guise of industrial espionage. Welcome to the 21st new century.				
				</p>

				<p>
				Aside from the creepy posterior and discarded euphoria, I hated absolutely everyone, including myself. I would spend each lunchtime in the library hiding away from the world, feeding off the moisture manifesting from my avid self-deprivation. "There's a delicate hand prying at my misery, burying memories at a haste last seen during the Great Depression."
				</p>
				<p>
				Fortunately, years of self-hate and brooding would develop into a coping mechanism sparing me the pity of my visible distress: my ability to make others laugh. My humour, as dry as a salted hooker's mouth, would allow me to mask the inconsistency of my mood and behaviour as a kind of quirk to be admired. I was even offered to become part of the jock and theatre groups following a string of particularly hilarious events, to which I arrogantly declined in dramatic fashion.
				</p>

				<p><span id="adelaidesucks"></span>I suppose my first attempt at media began with an online forum some kids in our year level had decided to propagate. It was very bootleg at the time, causing mischief for those who desired it. Naturally, as part of the in-grown tumor accommodating the seizure prone area of my brain, I thought it appropriate to create my own rival forum. Obviously, it would be bigger and better in every way, cultivating pride with grand hysteria. I'll spare you the details, however I ended up being suspended, with both treason and cyberbullying sighted as key reasons.</p>

				<p>So instead, to spare myself the future embarrassment of being a rampant liar, I decided to start a personal blog to note down my thoughts and feelings, entitled <a href="#adelaidesucks" title="adelaidesucks"><span class="b l">Adelaidesucks</span></a>. Why? Because there was a kid from Adelaide and like a pack of hyenas, felt obliged to make him feel death for it. If only we had a shooting range, would have crippled him from the waist down instead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite being an inadequate writer with a mild case of dyslexia and an inability to decipher between past and present tense, writing was an activity I loved and cherished. </p>

			<p>With no friends and an awkward attitude, I developed a habit of talking to myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			It was a way for me to flood the soul with a temporary diaspora, keeping what little hope I had alive in the lost hours spent online, pushing pixels as a replacement for the emotions in my brain. Soon I bought an audio recorder to keep the voices permanent. I would record zany shows, stupid voices aaaaaaand just about anything to remind myself that everything was perfectly fine in spite of the looming atrophy. </p>

			<p><span id="dottjt"></span>To further validate my self-worth I would create &lsquo;funny&rsquo; MySpace accounts, spamming random people to read my introduction paragraph to which they would provide their prefabricated opinions on how they found it the most brilliantly hilarious thing they've ever witnessed. I would then proceed to feel amazing about myself, as I'm sure we've all desired at some point in our lives.

			<p><span id="melbournesucks"></span><span id="sydneysucks"></span> <span id="hobartsucks"></span> <span id="perthsucks"></span>Inspired by YouTube pop culture I also experimented with video media for the first time, prompting me to create a somewhat unoriginal video game/music video compilation for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDNnr9xMHQ6hJHp6NKKPY5Q" title="dottjt YouTube channel"><span class="r l">dottjt</span></a> my very first YouTube channel. The video featured a montage of Super Smash Brothers' footage to the song "Smack That" by Akon. 15 year old me thought it was pretty cool.</p>

			<p>I also continued blogging, creating <a href="#melbournesucks" title="MelbourneSucks"><span class="b l">MelbourneSucks</span></a>, <a href="#sydneysucks" title="SydneySucks"><span class="b l">SydneySucks</span></a>, <a href="#hobartsucks" title="HobartSucks"><span class="b l">HobartSucks</span></a> and <a href="#perthsucks" title="PerthSucks"><span class="b l">PerthSucks</span></a> and in fact, an appropriate title for each Australian major city.

			<p> <span id="justanothertopicalafternoon"></span> Eventually it dawned on me that babbling incoherently into a recorder wouldn't be enough to keep the neurons firing. Listening to a lot of podcasts at the time (particularly Get This, featuring a young Ed Kavalee and The Spoonman on Triple M) I was keen to become a radio professional, and so I applied for a radio show at SYN FM. </p>

			<p>Thankfully my application was approved and my very first radio show <a href="#justanothertopicalafternoon" title="Just Another Topical Afternoon"><span class="o l">Just Another Topical Afternoon</span></a> was born. Presenting with a friend from high school I wrote and produced the whole thing, while he blessed me with turning up infrequently, often stoned, eventually not turning up at all. </p>

			<p>Aside from the visceral disagreement and choking fights I had with the station's general manager, I soon became obsessed with my amateur hobby, espousing bullshit for a pretty dime. After each show I would quickly rush home to edit the studio recording, to which I would sit and listen to the golden waves on repeat for hours on end, thinking it was simply magical. Hundreds, upon hundreds of times. 
			</p>

			<p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of producing radio was recieving on-air texts from listeners. There was this on-going joke on the show that you could win a date with me, which wasn't actually a joke, but a desperate ploy for a sexual hookup. Eventually, someone caved in and provided their number. Later admitting "she" was suicidal, I freaked out, only to be told that this suicidal teenager was actually an undercover cop doing what they claimed was "research". I called the number to the voice of a man, immediately hanging up in shame.
			</p>
			<p>
			I was the victim of a convincing prank. </p>

			<p> <span id="backhandfilms"></span> I didn't spend a lot of time creating things in my last year of high school, as I was too busy pretending to study, whilst actually playing Pokemon Diamond on my Nintendo DS. Following exams however I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do: I wanted to become the next big thing on YouTube. </p>

			<p>YouTube was beginning to gain traction as a platform and with the likes of mychonny and other self-obsessed personalities, I wanted to use my talents to make others laugh and obviously, become filthy rich and famous. With another arguably more sober friend from high school, we decided to create a YouTube channel entitled <a href="" title="Back Hand Films"><span class="r l">Back Hand Films</span></a> which at one point features a young Julius Reade wearing a corset, whilst being tea-bagged like a wet fish. We created videos and performed improv. </p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, the outfit wasn&rsquo;t destined to last. I didn&rsquo;t think he was funny and he thought I was too much of a control freak. We stopped being friends, newly displaced by the harsh reality of failure. </p>

		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="thefaptacularonehourspecial"></span> <span id="crack"></span> Enrolled in a Bachelor of Journalism at Monash University, I would soon further my involvement in community radio. At one point, I was on four different radio networks at the same time, extorting my pride like a crack pipe connected deep into the manic depression I thought candour.  </p>

			<p> <span id="wetalkyoudie"></span> At Radio Monash and 3SSR I partnered with my best friend at the time, presenting and producing <a href="#thefaptacularonehourspecial" title="The Faptacular One Hour Special"><span class="o l">The Faptactular One Hour Special</span></a> and <a href="#crack" title="CRACK"><span class="o l">CRACK</span></a> thinking it was going to be some kind of magical Hamish and Andy experience. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t. It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t really into the whole radio thing and with a wistful haste, the duo was in tatters. </p>

			<p> <span id="hiddencontroversy"></span> <span id="thehourlywage"></span> Hoping to regain some kind of common ground, we instead decided to start a website called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/we-talk-you-die/id448299058?mt=2" title="We Talk, You Die Podcast"><span class="p l">We Talk, You Die</span></a> which would feature both music and comedy articles, as well as a string of comedy videos. Of course, music and comedy didn&rsquo;t mix well and as my cynicism for journalism grew so did my involvement wane, eventually phasing myself out entirely altogether.</p>

			<p> <span id="visionaustraliaradio"></span>SYN FM was a different story. Whilst producing my radio show, <a href="#hiddencontroversy" title="Hidden Controversy"></a><span class="o l">Hidden Controversy</span>, I met a future collaborator which would lead to producing another show entitled <a href="#thehourlywage" title="The Hourly Wage"><span class="o l">The Hourly Wage</span></a> which I announced and he panelled. I would continue to collaborate with him to produce and record a radio play I had written, which after one successful initial recording, prompted him to bail on my project to produce his own series of podcasts. Naturally, we stopped being friends. </p>
			<p>
			As you can tell, none of my collaborations work out. </p>

			<p> <span id="thefinancialreality"></span> At the same time, I was also volunteering at <span class="o l">Vision Australia Radio</span> to read articles and present a youth radio show entitled Don't Hold Back. I would end up staying there for more than three years, producing and presenting more than 100 episodes of Don&rsquo;t Hold Back. Not that I enjoyed the experience. It simply looked good on my resume. </p>

			<p>I was also getting pretty involved with economics and finance at the time. As a journalism hopeful, I was learning quite a lot about the corruption in finance, which lead to me creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thefinancialreality" title="The Financial Reality 2011"><span class="r l">The Financial Reality</span></a> a YouTube channel designed to explain complex financial issues in layman's terms. Following many sleepless nights, I eventually managed to produce a nine minute video explaining the global debt crisis, which to this day has garnered more than 150,000 views. </p>
			<p>Please don&rsquo;t watch it. It makes me cringe like a piece of burnt plastic, wavering in the wind for mercy. </p>

		<li>Decided to give YouTube comedy another crack, unsuccessfully. </li>
		<li>The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up financial podcast appears. </li>
		<li>Drudge Report Report podcast, y'allo.</li>
		<li>Cracks appear in my mental health.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="boxes b8">
		<div class="main">
			<p> <span id="thezerohedgedailyroundup"></span>Earlier I had an idea for a podcast which I thought would be quite successful.</p>
			<p>
			As a self-confessed Zero Hedge fanatic (before the editorial team got hijacked), I thought there would be a media opportunity to summarise all the news items on the website, as well as provide my own take on them. The end result was <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-zero-hedge-daily-round-up/id494219092?mt=2" title="The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up"></a><span class="g l">The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up</span>, a six minute finance/comedy news bulletin that took three hours to produce each Tuesday to Saturday. I would wake up at 7:00am and have the podcast finished at 10:00am, just in time for New York audiences. </p>
				
				<p>
				It ended up being highly successful, with more than 55,000 downloads in a short nine months. I was even featured as a regular contributor on the Zero Hedge website! Unfortunately, despite the success of my podcast, the Zero Hedge crowd ousted me as a clown. They  thought I was immature and unfunny, which was understandable given the demographic. Though, it was still disheartening to think the community I'd embraced wanted nothing to do with me, so I stopped producing the podcast in October.</p>
				<p>
				Of course, there was a greater problem. My depression and mental health issues were beginning to exacerbate and take hold of my life. All the pressure I had put myself under to become a successful media personality, weighed by the failures of my past, were beginning to tear into the fabric of my self-perception. I simply couldn't keep up with my utterly debilitating expectations.
				</p>
				<p>Eventually, I stopped being consistent with my media. </p>

				<p><span id="drudgereportreport"></span> I would produce for weeks at a time, only to crash and burn into a horrible paralysis of immobile self-worthlessness. I would criticise myself, blaming my failure on my inability to just. be. better. In my arrogant stupor, I assumed my failure and worthless was due to not trying hard enough, which would prompt an even stronger response, only to disintegrate further and more spectacularly each time. </p>

				<p><span class="thefinanicalreality2012/2013"></span>	
				One of these responses was to create a second podcast in tandem with my existing podcast entitled <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/drudge-report-report/id562831680?mt=2" title="Drudge Report Report"><span class="g l">Drudge Report Report</span></a> which was a similar concept, however targeted at a much larger and more influential media outlet, which also rapidly grew in popularity totalling more than 29,000 downloads over a short 29 episodes.</p>
					<p>
				On the YouTube front however, I decided to mix my two passions: finance and comedy for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UfH_nmiNoXYSAUk8CVDPzoxYAAzkoGR" title=""></a><span class="r l">The Financial Reality 2012/2013</span> which would last from late-2012 to mid-2013. It's really hard to describe finanical comedy, but I guess it's just another flavour of satire for the masses to chow down on.
				
				<p><span id="juliusismyname"></span>A large portion of 2012 was also spent writing terrible, depressing poetry whilst being high on drugs. I distinctly remember recording a few episodes of the round up whilst tripping on LSD. I'd also travelled to France, England and China during the year.
					</p>

				<p>In classic Julius Reade fashion I also dedcided to give YouTube comedy another chance via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C75E66499028BB8" title="Juliusismyname YouTube channel"></a><span class="r l">Juliusismyname</span>. As you can imagine, it didn't work out, what with my crippling mental health issues.</p>

					<p>
					Then one day I just stopped. </p>
						
					<p>
					I stopped producing media altogether and gave up my ambitions of becoming the next big thing on YouTube or iTunes or anywhere. My mental health had gotten the best of me and I was entirely broken and distraught, wanting nothing more than to fade away and pretend the whole experience was just one large forgettable dream in a world far, far away.
					</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe, let alone empathise with mental illness, however I couldn&rsquo;t quite deal with the guilt and shame of burning out and disappearing for weeks at a time.
					</p>
					<p>
					I felt judged and vindicated, as if I were a complete and utter failure. All those broken collaborations and friends lost. Not to mention, the disaster that was university; a sopping failure of poor grades and pointless intuition. Nothing in my life seemed to be working out, and so I stopped.</p>

					<p> I had no reason to continue.</p>

						<p>	
					To assist you in understanding however, I will attempt to explain what it's like growing up with an Asian mother. You see, Asian mothers don't provide positive reinforcement. They see it as a form of weakness. Instead, what they do is judge and criticise you instead, pointing out the things you did wrong rather than what you may have done right. To them, that's sufficient motivation, regardless of how you actually feel on the inside.
					</p>
					<p>
					The consequence of this madness is that you become pessimistic. You only ever focus on the things you ever did wrong and when you fail, you proceed to criticise yourself, no different to how your parents treated you. It's emotional abuse on a level that makes me violent to even think about and something no one should ever experience in their entire lives. 
					</p>

					<p>But rather than truly give up and let go of all the pain and misdirection, I did what any unknowningly desperate person would do: chase one hopeless ambition for another, like a gambling addict chuffing down on a cigarette to mitigate the loses from a previous night's shuffle. </p>

					<p>
					I decided to pursue women.
					</p>

					<p><span id="inkquotes"></span><span id="tktxtktx"></span>Of course, I knew absoutely nothing about women, nor any actual women, which meant I had to be creative. This would lead me to writing on Tumblr. 
					</p>
					<p>
					I thought Tumblr would be a good outlet for a number of reasons. For starters, it wasn't a dating website, so it would subtle. Not to mention, the girls on Tumblr were usually mentally ill and as someone who was also struggling with a number of issues of their own, thought it would be a good match. In addition, it was an expressive outlet with an audience. Brilliant, I thought.  </p>

					<p>This lead to my first blog <a href="inkquotes.tumblr.com" title="inkquotes tumblr blog"><span class="pur l">inkquotes</span></a>. The idea was that I would handwrite quotes and girls would find them pretty. Initially, it was a bit of a disaster, however after one month of painstaking effort, I finally managed to hookup and within two months, secured my first girlfriend. I was over the moon like you cannot believe, later creating <a href="tktxtktx.tumblr.com" title="tktxtktx tumblr blog"><span class="pur l">tktxtktx</span></a> during our short relationship.</p>
					<p>
					Of course, what they don&rsquo;t tell you about love is that it&rsquo;s a horrible idea to become attached to someone who is not only mentally ill, but also suicidal, so naturally the relationship broke down and my mental health collapsed like a stack of cards. 
					</p>
					<p>So I overdosed. </p>

					<p>I distinctly remember screaming in the middle of the street as the heavy rain pierced through my skull, with the pleasure of the entire neighbourhood out on the street to watch me entrapped in a psychotic comatose. As the police approached me with their guns held firmly, I begged for them to shoot. Thankfully, they took me to the hospital instead, with my arm damaged from trying to punch in a glass door. Somehow, I still maintain a clean criminal record to this day. </p>
					<p>

					I thought maybe it would get her attention, or something. Who really knows why we do the things we do. </p>

					<p>Sometimes we just want to feel loved.</p>

				<div class="main">
					<p>It's unfortunate to think that my depression would get worse, before it ever got better.</p>
					<p>
					I became more and more irrational as the drugs flowed like dry ice through my veins, frequently trading one bad crowd for another. Highly insecure and blunted emotionally, I was taking more research chemicals than the factory could produce. I was like a chutney ragdoll. All that was left was to find the chord, and pull.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I vividly remember breaking down at work. I was unpacking a pallet of various gardening products and I remember staring into a bottle of liquid poison and thinking: "What possible difference would it make if I just swallowed the whole thing, right now?" It was arguably the first and last suicidal thought I would ever have.
					</p>
					<p><span id="sweetcherryerotica"></span><span id="blackwhiteinkcurvesxxx"></span><span id="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles"></span>
					I mean, what kind of a 21 year old hangs around a bunch 16 year old LADS in a bad part of town? Well, the internet, apparently. Drug dealers, arsonists and delinquents. I remember one kid Porky who was 15 and completely covered in tatts. Lebo. Crompty. Corey. Unfortunately, Kerser too.</p>
					
					<p>
					I think what made me stand out was my blatant naivety. I would insult people in ways that should have prompted a severe beating, only to be admired for the confidence. In one case I was absolutely pinging off my head, near an individual who was a juvenile criminal for smashing another person's head in. It's like his arms lived at the gym. So I went up to him and asked if I could shake his hand, as he smoked his cigarette around his mistresses. He reluctantly looked up and took the offer, to which I replied: "Now you can't staunch me." </p>

					<p>His face absolutely snapped.</p>

					<p>
					I thought maybe this is what it meant to be a journalist. The prerequisite danger. The shady characters. I guess I just wanted to feel special.</p>

					<p>The good news is that the insecurity, the drugs, not to mention the near death experiences which in one case, lead to being chased and subsequently robbed by a teenager with a meatcleaver, all made for incredibly interesting and brilliant writing. It helped fuel the content for my tumblr blogs, convincing women I was some kind of adventurous William S. Burroughs. I would go on to create <a href="sweetcherryerotica.tumblr.com" title="sweetcherry erotica"><span class="pur l">sweetcherry erotica</span></a>,
					<a href="blackwhiteinkcurvesxxx.tumblr.com" title="blackwhiteinkcurves"><span class="pur l">blackwhiteinkcurves</span></a> and
					<a href="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles.tumblr.com" title="brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles"><span class="pur l">brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles</span></a> writing in excess of 170,000 words.
				</p>
				<p>
				Of course, the glamour ends there and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t continue this life of arbitrary self-destruction. Following a string of bad women, I pledged to get off tumblr and instead focus solely on my mental health instead. In the process I ended up trading one addiction for another, soon turning to gambling and other false hopes to ease my woes. </p>
				<p>
				When I left Tumblr however, there was one girl I still wanted to keep in contact with. She&rsquo;d claimed to have already had a boyfriend, so I thought she wouldn't be a trigger and could just be my friend. So we added each other on Facebook and within five minutes, knew instantly it would result in a relationship (it turns out she was single) and we&rsquo;ve been together ever since. </p>

				<p>To celebrate my love for her, I wrote her a small book as a Christmas present. It&rsquo;s a few hundred pages, packed full of drawings, cartoons, jokes and pictures from our relationship. Oh, they joys of college unemployment.  </p>

				Graduating by the end of 2014, I reluctantly began my venture into full-time work. Aside from the leering mental health issues, there were also no journalism/writing jobs available for my utter lack of experience. In addition, I was beginning to doubt the authenticity of journalism as a career.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, The Reade&#8482  had a plan.
				
				</p>
				<p>
				 I was going to develop a writing portfolio so that by 2016, I could get a writing/journalism position. In the meantime, I would work full-time in various "off-cut" positions to get some experience in other areas. This writing portfolio was to become <a href="perspectivetheory.com" title="Perspective Theory"><span class="p l">Perspective Theory</span></a>, a website to help those suffering from depression, which would lead to me publishing more than 90,000 words.</p>
				<p>
				As I&rsquo;d been actively working on my mental health over the years, I&rsquo;d read enough about perspective and self-awareness to understand that my mind wasn't right. At the same time, no matter how hard I tried, none of this self-awareness mumbo-jumbo would ever work (a process I now realise takes many years) so I thought maybe I would have a better chance of internalising it if I wrote about it. Furthermore, it was a commitment to my mental health.
				<p>
				Did it work? Who knows, but I'm certainly a lot better now and it was a portfolio which would help my career tremendously. </p>
				<p>My first job was as an <a href="http://www.prolearn.com.au/" title="Prolearn"></a><span class="y l">Education Consultant</span> at ProLearn selling TAFE education over the phone to complete strangers, calling in excess of 300 people each day. Arguably, it was one of the most horrendous experiences of my life. Put simply, the turnover was so bad that you would see 30 new faces each week, to which half would be gone by the next day, with one or two people left by the end of the week. It was worse than a cult.
			</p>
			<p>
				The experience was so traumatic that it took me another two months before I would garner the courage to find another position, which lead me to becoming a <a href="http://mcleodrail.com.au/" title="McLeod Rail"><span class="y l">Digital Marketing Specialist</span></a> at McLeod Rail, which I was clearly unqualified for (I distinctly remember the MD shouting at me over my less-than-palatable email newsletter). </p>

				<p>Afterwards I discovered a <a href="http://www.ozwashroom.com.au/" title=""><span class="y l">Marketing Assistant and Administration</span></a> position at OzWashroom - a small operation which claimed to be the second largest washroom supplier nationally. Of course, I managed to get fired within three weeks. </p>

				<p>You see, in preparing for marketing positions, I was required to learn a lot of HTML/CSS and web design. As a result, I virtually spent all my time learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, to which I became obsessed. I absolutely adored code like you cannot imagine, so I would spend all my free time coding... particularly at work. Eventually I got caught out, being accused of hacking into their system to steal, in their words, "SEO" as I was put it.
				</p>

				<p><span id="elegantlyattached"></span>
				Now halfway through the year, I realised that I probably had enough writing experience to secure a sufficient position pushing words. Delivering a series of impressive interviews, I ended up as a Content Writer at Expotrade, a company responsible for producing major project and transport infrastructure projects. Extrodinarily, my title was immediately upgraded to <a href="http://www.expotradeglobal.com/" title="Expotrade Global website"><span class="y l">PR &amp; Communications Executive</span></a>, which sounded hella' good on paper.</p>

				<p>
				I also prompted to start another tumblr blog <a href="elegantlyattached.tumblr.com" title="elegantlyattached"></a><span class="pur l">elegantlyattached</span> before realising that a) already had a wonderful girlfriend and b) there were more pressing things to do with my time i.e. establish some sort of career.

				After much struggle I finally managed to get my mental health in order. I cut off all the toxic people in my life, including my own mother, and I managed to become mentally stable, which I still find oddly unsettling till this day. While it's nice, I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s inherently better. It's just more in line with my own goals. </p>

				<p>I don&rsquo;t take my emotions or episodes personally anymore. I very seldom get burnt out despite working twice as hard as I ever have, and most importantly, I no longer feel riddled with guilt or shame about who I am. My mind is simply calm and focused, honed on destroying the earth with my capitalist greed, shoving money into my pockets by the handful. It&rsquo;s like my brain has been upgraded, or something.</p>

				<p><span id="thefinanicalreality2015/2016"></span>One big worry the mentally ill have of mental stability is this idea that your ambition and character is inherently linked with your mental illness and ultimately disappears once you get better. However, I can ascertain that it only gets stronger. To actually have control over yourself is like being handed a gun, over a spear. And trust me, it's a lot harder to kill yourself with a spear.</p>

				<p>With my mental health in order, I decided to give YouTube comedy one last crack: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UfH_nmiNoUqZUvUVT3SclR8VLnT6Uss" title="The Financial Reality 2015/2016"><span class="r l">The Financial Reality 2015/2016</span></a> While it started out fine, soon evolved into a self-confessed reality of hate and incoherence. Was it funny? I'm not sure, however it certainly wasn't positive for my mental health, so I stopped.</p>
				<p>
				Expotrade, you have been lovely. While it wasn't the most interesting job at the best of times, it was an opportunity that I otherwise would never have dreamed of, and so thank you. Not to mention, the travel was pretty cool as well.
				</p>

				<p>Though if I had to sum up 2016, I would say that I spent a majority of it studying code. UNIX. Algorithms. JavaScript. WebGL.</p>

					<p> I mainly want to continue learning to become the best coder I can. I love code like you cannot imagine and it's been an absolute pleasure creating this website. I love data structures, algorithms, functional paradigms, you name it. I could talk about it for hours. I've mainly been focusing on HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Python, though I've messed around extensively with Clojure, Haskell, C and Java. I think I might take C# seriously.</p>
