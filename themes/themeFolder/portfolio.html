	<div class="boxes b2">
		
		<div class="main">
		<p>I was a shit kid.</p> 

		<p>
		I wasn't a particularly dedicated or passionate student and aside from the loose attitude, my superiority complex was so thick you could cut it with a knife and drain the tar for repentance. I hated everyone, including myself. I would spend each lunchtime in the library, hiding away from the world, feeding off the moisture manifesting from my own self-deprivation. 
		</p>
		<p>
		On a positive note however, I was also funny. It was a skill which spared me the pity of being visibly distressed, both physically and mentally. I was even offered to become part of the jock and theatre groups following a string of particularly hilarious events, to which I arrogantly declined in dramatic fashion. Apparently, being horrible was a skill I excelled at. 
		</p>
		<p>I suppose my first attempt at media began with an online forum some kids in our year level had decided to create. It was very bootleg. Naturally, the seizure prone area of my brain decided to create a rival forum, which would obviously aim to be better in every single way. I'll spare you the details, however I ended up being suspended. Both treason and cyberbullying were sighted as key reasons.</p>

		<p>Instead, I decided to start a personal blog as I thought it would be far less detrimental on my academic life, entitled <span class="b">Adelaidesucks</span>. Why? Because there was a kid from Adelaide and like a pack of hyenas, it was obligatory to make him feel death for it, as teachers would too.
		</p>

		<p>
		Even though I was a terrible writer with a mild case of dyslexia and an inability to descipher between past and present tense, it was a pastime I enjoyed greatly. </p>

		<p>With no friends, I had a habit of talking to myself. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In fact, I became so obsessed with my voice that I decided to buy an audio recorder to keep the voices in my head permanent. I would record zany shows, stupid voices aaaaaaand just about anything to remind myself that everything was. a .o. kay. </p>

		<p>To further validate my self-worth, I would create &lsquo;funny&rsquo; MySpace accounts, which I would then spam to random people, asking whether they found it the most brilliant thing on earth. They would then say yes (most of the time) and I would proceed to feel amazing about myself. It's amazing how well designed we are at self-delusion. 
		</p>		  

		<p>I also experimented with video media for the first time. Inspired by YouTube pop culture, I decided to create video game/music video compilations. I recorded and put together a montage of Super Smash Brothers' footage to the song Smack That by Akon.</p>

		<p>I also continued blogging, creating <span class="b">Melbournesucks</span> and <span class="b">Sydneysucks</span>. In fact, there is a blog for each Australian major city.</p>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Hosted my very first radio show at the age of sixteen. </li>
	<li>Became obsessed with podcasting. </li>
	<li>Sexting gone wrong. </li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b4">
		<div class="main">
		<p>Eventually it dawned on me that babbling incoherently into a recorder simply wasn&rsquo;t enough. Listening to a lot of podcasts at the time (particularly Get This, featuring a young Ed Kavalee and The Spoonman on Triple M), I was particularly keen to become a radio professional, and so I applied for my very own radio show at SYN FM. </p>

		<p>Thankfully my application was approved and my very first radio show, <span class="o">Just Another Topical Afternoon</span>, was born. Presenting with a friend from high school, I wrote and produced the whole thing, while he was assigned to turning up infrequently, often stoned, eventually not turning up at all. </p>

		<p>Aside from the visceral disagreements and choking fights I would have with the station's general manager, I soon became obsessed with my amateur hobby. After each show, I would quickly rush home to edit the studio recording, where I would sit and listen to the tape on repeat, hundreds upon hundreds of times. I thought it was magical.
		</p>

		<p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of producing radio is recieveing on-air texts from listeners. There was an on-going joke on the show that you could win a date with me, which soon became reality when a person offered their number. Later admitting "she" was suicidal, I freaked out, only to be told later that the person was actually an undercover cop doing research, having called the number to a man.
		</p>

		<p>
		More viably, I was the victim of a convincing prank. </p>

	<div class="boxes b6">
		<div class="main">
		<p>I didn't spend a lot of time creating things in my last year of high school, as I was too busy pretending to study, whilst actually playing Pokemon on my Nintendo DS. Following exams however, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do: I wanted to become the next big thing on YouTube. </p>

		<p>YouTube was beginning to gain traction as a platform and with the likes of mychonny and other self-obsessed personalities, I wanted to become something special. Collaborating with a friend from high school, we decided to make a YouTube channel called <span class="r">Back Hand Films</span>, which at one point features a young Julius Reade wearing a corset, whilst being teabagged. We created scripted videos and performed a lot of improv. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the outfit didn&rsquo;t work out. I didn&rsquo;t think he was funny and he thought I was too much of a control freak. In retrospect, I think we both realised that we were too individual to be able to work as a team. This not only ended our YouTube venture, however also our friendship. My dream was in ruins.  </p>

<div class="year">2011</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>SYN FM, 3SSR, Radio Monash and Vision Australia Radio.</li>
	<li>Created a video explaining global debt crisis.</li>
	<li>Started a music/comedy website. </li>
	<li>Wrote a radio play.</li>

</ul>

	<div class="boxes b7">
		<div class="main">
		<p>Enrolled in a Bachelor of Journalism at Monash University, I would soon further my involvement in community radio to fulfil my self-worth, following the failure of my YouTube comedy ambitions. At one point, I was on four different radio networks at the same time.  </p>

		<p>At <span class="o">Radio Monash</span> and <span class="o">3SSR</span> I partnered with my best friend at the time, thinking it was going to be some kind of magical Hamish and Andy experience. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t. It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t really into the whole radio thing and that he was much more interested in doing music journalism, and so the duo was in tatters, as would be our friendship into the future. </p>

		<p>Hoping to regain some kind of common ground, we instead decided to start a website called <span class="p">We Talk, You Die</span> which would feature both music and comedy articles and videos. Of course, the two didn&rsquo;t really mix and I didn't really see the point of comedy journalism, so I phased myself out and eventually we would stop speaking.</p>

		<p>SYN FM was a different story. Whilst producing my radio show, <span class="o">Hidden Controversy</span>, I met a future collaborator who I would later produce another show with entitle <span class="o">The Hourly Wage</span> which I announced and he panelled. I would continue to collaborate with him to produce and record a radio play I had written. After a successful initial recording, he bailed to produce his own series of podcasts and we stopped being friends. As you can tell, none of my collaborations ever seem to work out. </p>

		<p> <span class="o">Vision Australia Radio</span> was a different story. I would end up staying there for more than three years, responsible for reading articles for the bind. During my tenure I managed to produce and present more than 100 episodes of Don&rsquo;t Hold Back, a sort of youth radio show, which I arguably didn&rsquo;t enjoy but looked good on my resume. </p>

		<p>At the same time, I was getting pretty involved with economics and finance in my life. I simply found it fascinating. As a journalism hopeful, I was learning quite a lot about the corruption in finance, which lead to creating my YouTube channel <span class="r">The Financial Reality</span>. The channel aimed to explain complex financial issues in laymans terms. Following many sleepless nights, I eventually managed to produce a nine minute video explaining the global debt crisis, which to this day has more than 150,000 views. </p>

		<p>Please don&rsquo;t watch it. It makes me cringe, bad time.  </p>

<div class="year">2012</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Decided to give YouTube comedy another crack. </li>
	<li>Begun the Zero Hedge Daily Round Up podcast. </li>
	<li>Wrote terrible poetry whilst on drugs. </li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b8">
		<div class="main">
		<p>I had an idea for a podcast which I thought would be quite successful.</p>
		<p>
		As a self-confessed Zero Hedge fanatic (before it got hijacked), I thought there would be a media opportunity to summarise all the news items on the website, as well as provide my own take on them. The end result was <span class="g">The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up</span>, a six minute finance/comedy news bulletin that took 3 hours to produce each morning, each Tuesday to Saturday. I would wake up at 7am and finish at 10am. </p>
		
		<p>
		It ended up being highly successful, with more than 55,000 downloads in total. I was even featured as a regular contributor on Zero Hedge itself! Unfortunately, despite the success of my podcast, a large majority of the crowd disliked my humour and they thought it was immature. It was disheartening to think the community I had embraced thought I was a complete twat. </p>

		<p>
		Of course, there was a greater problem. My depression and mental illness issues were beginning to exacerbate and bring me down. All the pressure I had put on myself from my commitment, the failures of my past, including all the expectations of who I should be, weighed heavily on me. 
		</p>

		<p>It meant I was never consistent. I would produce media for weeks at a time, only to crash and burn into a horrible pit of depression and self-worthlessness. My only response was to criticise myself further. I assumed that my feelings were due to a lack of effort, and so I would come back harder and stronger, only to crash and burn out more spectacularly each time. </p>

		<p>
		To try harder I created a second podcast in tandem entitled <span class="g">Drudge Report Report</span> which was a similar concept, however targeted a much larger and more influential media outlet. While the popularity grew rapidly, I eventually crashed to a point of complete apathy, stopping media altogether. </p>
		</p>

		<p>
		While it seems stupid in retrospect, it was simply how I was raised as a child. It is something I picked up from my mother, through her constant judgment and criticism of every single thing about my personality. To move forward with my mental health, I would later proceed to disown her and cut off all contact completely. Certainly, my happiness and mental health has improved dramatically since then.   	
		</p>

		<p>
		On the YouTube front I decided to mix my two passions: finance and comedy. I would create these stupid little comedy videos for my financial YouTube channel, which I focused solely on creating once I had finished up the round up in October. This would last until mid-2013. I also decided to give YouTube comedy a second crack, which lasted four episodes until my mental health gave in.</p>
		</p>

		<p>It begs to say that I also spent a large portion of 2012 writing terrible, somewhat sexual poetry whilst being high on drugs. I distinctly remember recording a few episodes of the round up whilst tripping on LSD. I'd also travelled to France, England and China.

<div class="year">2013</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Started using tumblr to find women.</li>
	<li>The depression worsens. </li>
	<li>Writing becomes excessive. </li>

</ul>

	<div class="boxes b9">
		<div class="main">

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe mental illness, however I couldn&rsquo;t quite deal with the guilt and shame of burning out and disappearing for weeks at a time.
		</p>

		<p>
		I felt judged and vindicated and with the constant self-criticism, came the feeling of complete and utter failure. All those dead collaborations. All those friends lost, not to mention, the disaster that was university. Nothing in my life seemed to be working out, and so I stopped. I stopped producing media altogether. </p>

		<p>But rather than give up and let go of all the pain and misdirection, I did what any unknownly desperate person would do: chase one hopeless ambition for another. I decided to pursue a different goal instead: Women. Though really, like any chase in life, you did it for hope. The hope that something might turn out right in your life.
		</p>

		<p>I knew zero women at the time (and arguably my entire life) and so I had to be inventive. I figured tumblr would be a good outlet, as it would be subtle as a non-dating website. Not to mention, the girls on tumblr were usually mentally ill as well and so I figure we&rsquo;d probably click. In addition, I could also write and have my writing appreciated, so it was kind of a win/win.</p>

		<p>This lead to my first blog <span class="pur">inkquotes</span>. Initially it was a bit of a disaster, however after one month of painstaking effort, I finally managed to kiss a girl and within two months, I secured my first girlfriend. I was over the moon like you cannot believe. I thought I'd died and went to heaven. I later created <span class="pur">tktxtktx</span> during our relationship.</p>

		<p>
		Of course, what they don&rsquo;t tell you is that it&rsquo;s a horrible idea to fall in love with someone else who is also mentally ill AND suicidal, so naturally the relationship broke down and my mental health collapsed. I overdosed on a variety of drugs and ended up in hospital.
		</p> 

		<p>I thought maybe it would get her attention, or something.</p>

<div class="year">2014</div>

<ul class="tldr">
	<li>Depression explodes.</li>
	<li>Quit tumblr to focus on my mental health, sort of.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b10">
		<div class="main">
		<p>My depression got worse.</p>

		<p>
		I became more and more irrational, frequently trading one bad crowd for another. I was highly insecure and an emotional wreck at the best of times. I was frequentlysmoking weed and taking research chemicals without consequence. I didn&rsquo;t value myself and I would do anything women said.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I vividly remember breaking down at work. I was unpacking a pallet of various liquids and I remember picking up a bottle of gardening poison and thinking: "What possibly difference would it make if I just swallowed the whole thing right now?" It was a low point and the first and last suicidal thought I'd ever had. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I mean, what kind of a 21 year old hangings around 16 year old LADS in bad parts of town? Well, the internet, apparently. Drug dealers, arsonists and delinquents. I remember one kid named porky who was 15 and completely covered in tattoos. He got aggressive when I poked fun at his mother, however the confidence impressed him. Part of me was attracted to the danger. I thought maybe this is what it meant to be a journalist. </p>

		<p>The good news is that the insecurity, the drugs, the near death experiences, all made for incredibly interesting and brilliant writing. It helped fuel the content for my tumblr blogs, convincing women I was some kind of adventurous William S. Burroughs, my idol at the time. I would go on to create <span class="pur">sweetcherry erotica</span>,
		<span class="pur">blackwhiteinkcurves</span> and
		<span class="pur">brokenheartsandfracturedsmiles</span> writing in excess of 170,000 words.
		</p>

		<p>
		Of course,  I knew I couldn&rsquo;t continue this life of arbitrary mischievous forever. Following a string of bad women, I pledged to get off tumblr and instead focus solely on my mental health and break the cycle of my insecurity. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. I ended up trading one addiction for another, soon turning to gambling and pornography to ease my woes. </p>

		<p>
		When I left however, there was one girl I still wanted to keep in contact with. She&rsquo;d claimed to have already had a boyfriend when I last spoke to her, so I thought she might make a nice friend. So we added each other on Facebook and within 5 minutes, I instantly knew we would be in a relationship (it turns out she was single) and we&rsquo;ve been together ever since. </p>

		<p>To celebrate my love for her, I wrote her a small book for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a few hundred pages, packed full of drawings, cartoons, jokes and pictures. I couldn't begin to tell you how long it took to make.  </p>

	<li>Full-time working career begins.</li>
	<li>Launched Perspective Theory.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxes b11">
		<div class="main">
		<p>This is where I rebound.</p>

		<p>
		Graduating at the end of 2014, I reluctantly began my venture into full-time work. Aside from my depression and mental health issues, there were also no journalism/writing jobs available for my experience. In addition, I was beginning to doubt the authenticity of journalism as a career.</p>

		<p>Thankfully, I had a plan. I was going to develop a writing portfolio so that by 2016, I could get a writing/journalism position. In the meantime, I would work full-time in various "offcut" positions to bathe myself in a wide variety of work experiences. That writing portfolio was to become <span class="p">Perspective Theory</span>, a website to help those suffering from depression. </p>

		<p>
		As I&rsquo;d been actively working on my mental health over the years, I&rsquo;d read enough about perspective and self-awareness to understand how it worked. At the same time, I couldn't get it to consistently work, so I thought maybe if I were to write about it, I'd get better at managing my mental health. Ultimately, I ended up publishing more than 90,000 words, writing a hell of a lot more. </p>

		<p>My first job was as an <span class="y">Education Consultant</span> at ProLearn selling TAFE education. It was one of the most horrendous experiences of my life. Put simply, the turnover was so bad that you would see 30 new faces each week. Most would be gone within a few weeks, almost all by the end of the month. 
		</p>

		<p>
		The experience was so traumatic that it took me another two months before I could garner the courage to find another position, which lead me to discover a <span class="y">Digital Marketing Specialist</span> position I was clearly unqualified for (I distinctly remember the MD shouting at me over my &laquo;&#160;terrible&#160;&raquo; email newsletter). </p>

		<p>Afterwards I discovered a <span class="y">Marketing Assistant</span> position at Ozwashroom - a small operation which claimed to be the second largest washroom supplier nationally. Of course, knowing me, managed to get fired after three weeks. </p>

		<p>You see, in preparing for marketing positions, I was required to learn a lot of HTML/CSS and web design. As a result, I virtually spent all my time learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript, which I became virtually obsessed with. I would spend all my free time coding... particularly at work. Eventually I got caught out and I was accused of hacking into their system to steal, in their words, their "SEO" as I was put it. 
		</p>

		<p>Now halfway through the year, I realised that I probably had enough experience to secure a proper writing position. Delivering a series of impressive interviews, I ended up as a Content Writer at <span class="y">Expotrade</span>, a company responsible for all the major project and transport infrastructure projects within the state. Actually, my title was immediately upgraded to a PR &amp; Communications Executive, which couldn&rsquo;t have sounded more impressive, at least on paper.</p>

		<p>What a beautiful year. </p>

		<p>
		After much struggle I finally managed to get my mental health in order. I cut off all the toxic people in my life, including my own mother. I managed to become mentally stable, which having never been mentally stable, is quite the achievement. Honestly, it's weird. I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s inherently better, just more in line with my own goals. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t take my emotions or episodes personality. I very seldom get burnt out despite working twice as hard as I ever have, and most importantly, I no longer feel riddled with guilt or shame about who I am. My mind is simply calm and focused, allowing me to pursue my ambition with an unrecognisable force. It&rsquo;s like my brain has been upgraded or something.</p>

		<p>One of the big worries about becoming mentally stable is that you think your ambition and character will disappear, however I can ascertain that it only gets strong. To actually have control over yourself is like being given a gun over a spear.</p>

		<p>
		The other good thing is that I no longer desire the rebellion from my past. I&rsquo;ve gotten more than enough interesting stories to tell and I think I've taken enough drugs to last a lifetime. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve produced all the inappropiately offensive comedy I could ever have possibly wanted. </p>

		<p>With my mental health in order, I decided to give YouTube comedy one last crack. While it started out fine, soon evolved into pure hate and and incoherence, almost by design. Regardless, it wasn&rsquo;t contributing towards my mental health and so I stopped. Was it funny? I'm not sure.</p>

		<p>If I had to sum up everything I've done this year, I would say I spent a majority of this year studying code. </p>

		<p> Mainly, I want to focus on my coding. </p>

		<p>While I might get back into YouTubing/Podcasting at some point, I feel like I&rsquo;ve achieved enough to last a lifetime and that there are other things that are more urgent in my life. I still write on my medium blog from time to time. </p>
			
		<p>I&rsquo;m also currently in the process of developing a mental health guide, which is roughly 20,000 words through, though I&rsquo;ve probably written 80,000 words over various drafts, trying to conquer this thing. </p>
