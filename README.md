# v1

The very first personal website I built. 

Actually, it was technically the third one I built. The first one was easily the most hideous thing I ever created and the second one was the second most hideous thing I ever created. I suppose this is the first one I published.

It begs to say that the codebase is an absolute mess. I didn't even understand how static generators worked at the time, so I didn't use it as it should have been.
